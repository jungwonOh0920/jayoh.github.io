# ⚡️Closure
Definition: the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to it surrounding state (the lexical environment). It gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. -*[ref by mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)* 

Thus, I have no idea. 🤯

So, I decided to understand what it literally means. By the Google dictionary, it means 
> an act or process of closing something, especially an institution, thoroughfare, or frontier, or of being closed.
> 
> similar words: shutdown, termination
> 
> *In Korean: 폐쇠, 종결*

So, I asked myself like what does it shutdown from? In order to answer that, I needed to know about `scope`. 

Scope is considered as a range that determines the accessibility of variables. There are 3 types of scope:
- Global scope
- Function scope
- Block scope

Global variables can be accessed from anywhere. 
``` javascript
let name = "jay";
// the name variable is accessible here

function myfunc() {
    // the name variable is accessible here
}
```
The `Window` object exists on web browsers. Since it contains the global scope, when a variable is declared with `var`, it becomes a member variable of the window object. 



<!-- `const`, `let`, and `var`. -->


How I understand: 
자신이 선언될 당시의 환경을 기억하는 함수

## Lexical Scope
함수를 어서 호출는지가 아니라, 어에 선언하였는지에 따라 결정되는 것을 말함. 즉 함수를 어디서 선언하였는지에 따 상위스코프를 결정한다는 뜻이며, 중요한 점은 함수의 호출이 아니라 **함수의 선언**에 따 결정된다. -> 정적스코프

ex)
```javascript
const x = 1
function first() {
    const x = 10
    second()
}
function second() {
    console.log(x)
}
first() // 1
second() // 1
```
