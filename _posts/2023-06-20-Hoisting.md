# Hoisting

Hoisting is a concept that variables are hoisted to the top of the **scope** before code execution. For example,
```javascript
console.log(temp) // doesn't cause an error. It just prints undefined
var temp = 1
console.log(temp) // 1
```
In this code, it already knows `temp` even before the declaration because it's hoisted. When I do the same thing with `const` or `let`, it throws an error so I thought hoisting is not happening with those two, but it's wrong. ðŸ¤¯ Let's see the following examples.

```javascript
console.log(temp2) // RefError: temp2 is not defined
const temp = 1
console.log(temp) // 1
```
Of course, the error message says *it's not defined* because it's not defined. What about the following code?

```javascript
console.log(temp) // RefError: Cannot access 'temp' before initialization
const temp = 1
console.log(temp) // 1
```
When I'm trying to print `temp` before declaration, it says *cannot access temp*. It's a different error than the one above. It "knows" that `temp` is, but it just does not have the access to it. So, hoisting is happening. ðŸ¤¯

Those hoisted variables with `let` and `const` are placed in the Temporal Dead Zone(TDZ) before initialization. 

```javascript
console.log(temp) // It's in TDZ
const temp = 1
console.log(temp) // 1
```

Let's take a look at another example.
```javascript
let age = 20;
function printAge() {
    console.log(age) // Access error because of hoisting that happens in the scope. age is in TDZ. 
    let age = 10;
}
printAge()
```
If hoisting didn't happen, it should just print 20 that comes from the line right above the function.

## `let`, `const`, and `var`

3 steps for a variable.
1. declaration
2. initialization
3. assignment

`var`: declaration and initialization happens at the same time. initialized as undefined. Then assigned later.

`let`: declaration and initialization happens seperately. It is declared when hoisting happens.  

`const`: all happen at the same time. 

```javascript
let name
name = 'Jay'

var age
age = 20

const gender
gender = 'male' // error
```

`var` is function scope whereas `let` and `const` are block scope.

```javascript
const age = 20;

if(age>19) {
    var txt = 'adult'
}

console.log(txt) // adult
```
`txt` is accessible because `var` is **function scope**, not block scope.

```javascript
function add(num1, num2) {
    var result = num1 + num2
}

add(1,2)
console.log(result) // RefError: result is not defined
```
`var` cannot be accessed outside the function.
